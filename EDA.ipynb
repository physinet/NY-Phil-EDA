    "When planning a concert season, modern professional orchestras have to strike balance between choosing artistically and culturally rich repertoire and choosing pieces of music that will attract an audience and allow the musicians to earn a living. This has unfortunately created a strong bias in programming the famous works of deceased white male composers, because the celebrated masterworks of those composers will surely draw crowds. Programs remain relatively non-diverse to this day, despite continued calls for programming new music.\n",

Here, we will analyze the [archival program records](https://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/open-data) from the New York Philharmonic with the goal of determining how \"adventurous\" each concert is. From the records, we can extract details about every work performed on a concert program. By tracking the composers represented on each concert, we can determine whether or not a concert is adventurous.\n",
